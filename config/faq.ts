    question: "Why does the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) exist?",
    answer: `<p>What we've created with the RESF is an organizational body designed to help open source projects thrive with a structure that ensures a balanced and fair distribution of community control while specifically enabling enterprise use-cases, vendors, and commercial entities. Our charter and bylaws set forth an inclusive management framework, commitment, and accountability to ensure the longevity and success of our hosted open source projects and their respective communities.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Our vision is to create and nurture a community of individuals and organizations that are committed to ensuring the longevity, stewardship, and innovation of enterprise grade/class open source software that is always freely available.</p>
    <br />    
    <p>We invite all individuals and organizations who believe in this vision to stand with us and be part of this Foundation and Projects.</p>`,

    <br />
    <p>At the time of this writing, Rocky Linux is the main project and focus of the RESF, but we hope to join with more open source projects that are aligned with our vision and provide resources, structure, and support to them.</p>

  {
    slug: "underlying-principles",
    question: "What are the underlying principles that guide the RESF?",
    answer: `<p>Our guiding principles are: community responsibility, management, and control; ensuring that all dependencies, sources, and build artifacts are free, open source and reproducible; being receptive to adopt and support other projects within the open source community with similar values; transparency in our decision making, organization, and development; enablement of commercial interests in a way that creates a positive feedback loop back into sustainable open source projects and commercialization; and lastly growth and equality of opportunity for individuals and organizations, everyone is welcome.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Each of these principles are elaborated on within Article II of our charter.</p>
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "is-resf-nonprofit",
    question: "Is the RESF a non-profit?",
    answer: `<p>The RESF is a self-imposed not-for-profit organization founded as a Delaware Public Benefits Corporation (PBC). We are not a US IRS tax exempt organization as we believe they are not well equipped to protect open source projects nor are they a magic pill for integrity and doing the right thing for the community at large.</p>
    <br />
    <p>When most people think of a “non-profit” in the US, they usually consider a 501(c)3. These are typically charitable organizations and they are intended to serve the public interest. But it has been harder and harder for open source projects and foundations to obtain a 501(c)3 designation from the IRS which seems to be “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140416105516/https://www.wired.com/2013/06/irs-open-sourc/">struggling with figuring out which of these projects are true to the spirit of 501(c)(3) requirements, and which are simply there to help sell products</a>”. For this reason many projects have instead obtained 501(c)6 designations which are designed to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopick03.pdf"?promote common business interests among the corporate sponsors, boards, and members</a>. Couple that with a “pay to play” model of selling of board seats for votes, and you can imagine how it would be possible to pivot control toward a few well funded companies or individuals. We chose not to go that route.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Should open source projects or Foundations even be US tax exempt? According to Simon Phipps perhaps not; "<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2611441/open-source-projects-aren-t-tax-scams.html?page=2">Maybe the answer is for open source foundations to get out of the nonprofit world. Tax breaks are fine, but they aren’t the primary goal of open source foundations. What matters to their communities is that they have transparent, equal governance that allows everyone to contribute to and benefit from the project without obstruction. The IRS does not warrant that; it’s a matter instead of community scrutiny.</a>”</p>
    <br />
    <p>We agree and believe that what truly matters for a successful open source community is: transparency, open leadership, dedication to the community, longevity, community accountability, checks and balances, and growth with equal opportunity for everyone.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The structure we created was well thought out and designed to align with these goals to benefit the community at-large. The bylaws and charter solidifies our intentions, creates transparency, and the RESF welcomes community scrutiny and to be held accountable.</p>

  {
    slug: "gregory-kurtzer-owner",
    question: "Is Gregory Kurtzer the owner of the RESF?",
    answer: `<p>Yes, Greg owns the legal entity of the RESF (somebody has to!).</p>
    <br />
    <p>This is common within the open source community even for large projects. For example Ubuntu, Python, OpenBSD, Slackware, Ruby, Perl, and even the Linux kernel itself, all are (or have been) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">owned and/or controlled by a single individual</a>. That does not and should not detract from the value, integrity, or impact of any of those projects.</p>
    <br />
    <p>By ratifying the bylaws and charter, Greg has turned over the control of the RESF to the structure defined within those documents. There is now no single leadership position and everything is run by elected boards and contributing individuals. This means that if Greg does a good job, he might be elected to a board seat, and if not, or if he is unavailable, others will be elected.</p>
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "kurtzer-control",
    question: "But if Gregory Kurtzer owns the RESF, doesn't he still have control over it?",
    answer: `<p>As a member of the foundation, Greg is subject to the same rules and functions as everyone else, but the question is still valid.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As the owner, Greg could retract the bylaws completely and unilaterally; an action that would essentially shut down the RESF and be a very public signal to the community that something unanticipated has happened which jeopardizes the Projects (e.g. Board manipulation, takeover of control, etc.).</p>
    <br />
    <p>Contingency planning is critical to the long term success of an open source project, and we all take that commitment very seriously. Greg’s role may not always be that of decision making, but he will be there to resolve any unforeseen complications in the RESF and to ensure the long term survival and community control of each of the hosted Projects.</p>

  {
    slug: "rl-resf-ciq",
    question: "Does Rocky Linux or the RESF belong to CIQ?",
    answer: `<p>No. The RESF nor the Projects are beholden to any single company.</p>
    <br />
    <p>CIQ has been and continues to be a massive enabler for Rocky Linux and the RESF since its inception, but we made a decision early on that successful open source projects should not be subject or hostage to corporate control. What makes a successful open source project isn’t having a single individual behind it, nor is it having a massive company behind it, rather it is having many individuals and many companies all behind and managing it collectively, which has been our goal from day one.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But because of CIQ’s involvement, support, and help creating Rocky Linux (and the RESF), we do recognize CIQ as being the founding and primary corporate backer to Rocky Linux. We are very grateful to CIQ and happy they are providing commercial value-adds to the community, but this doesn’t mean that CIQ has any special control or access over Rocky Linux or the RESF. CIQ does not directly control any decisions, Boards, resources, secure keys, boot shims, or infrastructure, that is all 100% within the community. Even if CIQ doubles, triples, or more their support for Rocky Linux, the control structure for Rocky Linux won’t change, and it is always going to stay in the community (see board structure below regarding corporate limitations).</p>
    <br />
    <p>CIQ has agreed to contribute to a project that they don’t control and they are happy to follow and have faith in the community to lead the RESF and Rocky Linux. This sort of a relationship for a company to take with an open community is very exciting and supportive for everyone. We hope that more companies follow the lead of CIQ.</p>

    question: "When and why were the bylaws and charter written?",
    answer: `<p>When we first began, our goal was to create a new Enterprise Linux derivative, addressing a critical pain point for the community. Now that we’ve done that, and built the infrastructure to facilitate a larger breadth of features and longevity of the project, we refocused to codify the organizational structure for the benefit of the new community which has formed around the vision of stable, collaborative, community focused open source projects.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>We started thinking about this very early on, and as we progressed with building Rocky Linux, our ideas matured into a vision that is much bigger than just a free rebuild of RHEL. The initial drafts started in May 2022 and we worked on it until November 2022, when it was finalized and ratified.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We are very excited to bring this to the community as a testament of who we are, what we believe in, how we operate, and extend a tangible promise to the community who we openly ask to hold us accountable.</p>

    question: "Why has the RESF chosen this structure and bylaws and not simply adopted those from an existing open source foundation like the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation or others?",
    answer: `<p>The RESF structure is different from other open source foundations only in that it takes what we feel is the best of each and brings them together into a unique structure. You will find similarities among all of those listed, and our uniqueness is based on how we mixed everything together and superimposed this structure on top of how we basically operate today while striving to achieve a balance between community and the needs of enterprise organizations.</p>

  {
    slug: "preventing-centos",
    question:
      "How does this prevent what happened with CentOS from happening again with the RESF and Rocky Linux?",
    answer: `<p>First, to mention the obvious, CentOS Linux has been amazing to millions of people and organizations around the world, and we strive to be as purposeful to the world as CentOS has been. Many of our goals are modeled exactly from what made CentOS so amazing, but that doesn’t mean that some things couldn’t be improved, and that is where we really focused…</p>
    <br />
    <p>We are ensuring the long term success of Rocky Linux and the RESF by guaranteeing:</p>
    <br />
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-7">
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1"><span class="font-bold">Accountability</span>: State what we are going to do and be accountable for doing it</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Community</span>: The organizational structure is built around checks and balances always ensuring the community’s benefit</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Corporate</span> Balance: Absolute transparency including checks and balances between community and corporations</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Inclusion</span>: Make sure that everyone who wants to be involved, can be involved</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-1"><span class="font-bold">Growth</span>: Projects with many members and voices tend to be more stable and longer lasting</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>In short, under our bylaws, it is impossible for any single company or individual (including Kurtzer) to hijack or hold any of the RESF Project(s) hostage. But this is only one facet of what these bylaws do and we believe that now the RESF and all hosted Projects provide what individuals, organizations, and enterprises need to rely on for decades to come.</p>`,

    question: "Who is on the board of directors?",
    answer: `<p>Unlike many open source foundations, the RESF does not believe in “selling” board seats or votes. All Board Members deserve to be there based on merit, elected by their peers within the community, not who can afford the largest donation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As of the current board of director elections, the RESF is composed of 2 RESF Members, 1 RESF Officer (TBD), 3 Independents, and 5 Project Representatives:
    <br />
    <ul>

  },
  {
    slug: "open-community-voting",
    question: "Why not allow the open community to vote on the boards?",
    answer: `<p>All board seats should be elected based solely on merit. To achieve this, only the active RESF Project contributors (a.k.a. Members) who see the reality of everything that is happening within the Projects and the Foundation can make merit based judgment calls that the open community may not ever see. This also serves as an incentive for the open community to become contributing members.</p>
    <br />
    <p><em>note: Board seats are NEVER sold. As mentioned above, they are based only on merit. PERIOD. No company can ever express pressure on the RESF or Projects simply by spending money. This is unlike most other open source Foundations and the RESF is strongly committed to this.</em></p>
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "project-funding",
    question: "If you don't sell board seats for membership dues, how will the Projects be funded?",
    answer: `<p>The RESF believes in merit based control and ensuring that all Projects are led by the best individuals for that role. All Board seats should be held by the individuals who know the needs of the Foundation and Projects best. Selling Board seats not only risks misalignment with the community, but it also alienates the people who contribute to the Project as a <em>labor of love</em>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Funding of the RESF is provided by both RESF Sponsors as well as individual donations. These funds will be used according to the discretion of the RESF Board of directors and can be designated for things like legal expenses, hosting, physical hardware, tokens, and on occasion, compensation of contribution activity.</p>
    <br />
    <p>While the RESF does not sell any Board seats, we will however, grant a single advisory seat for each Tier1 Principal Sponsor. The advisory committees do not hold controlling or director positions within the RESF or Projects; they exist to provide guidance and collaboration.</p>

    <p>Organizations interested in becoming a sponsor and learning about the multiple benefits of RESF sponsorship should contact sponsor@resf.org.</p>
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "who-elects-board-members",
    question: "Who elects the board members?",
    answer: `<p>RESF Members have several responsibilities to the RESF and Projects, one of those is to nominate, second, and vote for the board seats. It is important for the RESF that all elections are done via RESF Members, the people who are working directly on the RESF Projects and Project Teams to ensure that the best candidates are elected to board positions.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We strive for a meritocracy, so under no circumstances will board seats or votes be sold to the highest bidders. Everyone who has been elected to these seats are there because the Project Members believe they belong there and all Members can be eligible for leadership positions.</p>

Projects do not even need to be Linux-related, but they must be open source under an OSI approved license with a preference towards non-copyleft.</p>

  {
    slug: "other-projects-join-resf",
    question: "Why would other Projects want to join the RESF?",
    answer: `<p>There are numerous reasons why open source projects would benefit by being part of the RESF, here are a few for consideration:</p>
    <br />
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-7">
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">The RESF provides a neutral ground for open source projects to be managed in a way that will guarantee transparency, commitment, and fairness to help build and sustain a community around the project.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">The RESF has resources available to open source projects and infrastructure that is available to benefit from an economy of scale. These include legals, Mattermost chat infrastructure, Google email/docs/calendaring, wikis, Git/project hosting, email lists, etc.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">The RESF strives for sustainability of open source projects, and to do that, there must be a combination of community management balanced with sponsor and partner commercialization and a commitment to “return the wealth” back into the open source community for the Project.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Open source projects benefit from collaboration and support from other open source communities, and the RESF provides a fantastic collaboration point for various Projects and communities.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">The RESF is well funded by companies and sponsors and we can help open source projects build and host the resources they need to be successful.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Every Project gets a voice within the Foundation. We have a logical structure such that every Project will have a Project Board, and each Project Board will have a seat on the Foundation Board. Complete transparency and balance across every Project and Team.</li>
    </ul>
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "company-projects-resf",
    question: "Why would a company want to put their open source projects into the RESF?",
    answer: `<p>Open source is not a marketing gimmick or hype generating tool, it is a collaborative and effective development model that inherently builds longevity, stability, transparency, trust, and community behind an idea or development initiative. But when open source projects are controlled behind the locked doors of executive offices and boardrooms, the decisions are always in the fiduciary interest of the company, not the open source Community; at times these decisions align but many times, they do not.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The fix is for organizations to free these open source projects to community foundations.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The RESF was designed specifically to align the values and benefits of true open source collaborative development with the needs of corporate vendors and professional IT teams. This is the model behind Rocky Linux and one of the major reasons it is so successful today; from commercial support and value adds, to a number of large organizations as commercial sponsors and partners all working together to ensure the long term success of critical open source projects.</p>

    question: "What is a Project Board and how does it relate to the RESF Board?",
    answer: `<p>Each Project Board exists under the RESF (Foundation) Board and there can be any number of Project Teams beneath it. Each Project Board will have a chair and a vice-chair on the RESF board for a single vote. This provides a top level RESF Board structure which has representation and board visibility to all Projects within the Foundation. This creates a system of checks and balances in the RESF Board proper as well as between the Project Boards.</p>

  {
    slug: "why-become-member",
    question: "Why should I become an RESF member?",
    answer: `<p>Members are recognized contributors to the Foundation and/or Projects. Being a Member means that you are an active participant to one or more RESF Projects which provides you the opportunity to take part in leadership decisions and presentations on what is happening, see what is on the horizon, be aware of new things that are coming with other Projects, and have a formal voice with the RESF.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Additionally, every member has a direct path to become a Team Lead/Deputy, Officer, Project Board Member, RESF Board Member, or a Board Chair. Every level of the organization becomes available to Members, and all Members influence all decisions such as who gets what roles within the Foundation and Projects.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Becoming a member is something that you can legitimately put on your resume, CV, or LinkedIn that you are part of one of the fastest growing initiatives that most large organizations worldwide are aware of.

    <br />
    <p>Becoming a member to a Project or Project Team is simply a matter of being active in that Project and applying. You don’t need technical experience to do this. There are many ways to be active in a Project, from code contributions, to supporting and helping others, to documentation, to organization, advocating, evangelizing, community, etc. The application will be reviewed by the Project Board to make sure that the applicant is indeed an active participant to the Project.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The logical steps are:</p>
    <br />
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-7">
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Get on IRC or Mattermost (https://chat.rockylinux.org) and/or our Discourse forum (https://forums.rockylinux.org/)</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Participate in discussions in channels that interest you</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Become an active contributor to a Project or Project Team by interacting and helping others</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">Complete an application form for the Project or Project Team</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1">The Project Board will review the application and either approve or disapprove the application based on a majority vote of the Project Board</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>The process is designed to be inclusive to everyone who wants to join the RESF and/or RESF Projects and will always be based solely on merit and merit alone. If you are not currently an active member but want to be, other members will work to bring you up to speed and mentor you so you can become an active member and be eligible for Membership.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But while everyone is welcome to be a Member, Members who are no longer active will be removed via the terms of the bylaws.</p>    
    `,
  },
  {
    slug: "difficult-to-become-member",
    question:"Why is it more difficult to become a member of the RESF than other open source foundations?",
    answer: `<p>Membership provides a critical role to the Foundation, the right to vote for board members and become Project or Foundation leaders. Because we strive to be a meritocracy, it is most important for everyone voting to understand clearly what is needed for the benefit of the organization, Projects, and teams and thus the community. Also, it is important to ensure that elections are fair and always in the best interest of the general public and community.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Becoming a member isn’t difficult, but it does require being an active contributor to the Foundation and/or one or more Project Teams.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you aren’t currently active on any Project Teams, but you want to be, please reach out to any of the Project Team leads, Team Deputies, or existing Members (privately if you wish). Our culture, encouraged by our principles and bylaws, provides value to all existing Members who mentor others by making them eligible for board elections, so reach out to them and make yourself available to be part of the team!</p>
